					//use ('\t') for tab separated values and (',') for comma separated values//

	B = GROUP Titanic by pclass;

	C = FOREACH B generate GROUP, AVG(Titanic_all.fare);
	
	dump C;


Q.2) Find no. of people alive in each class and are embarked in Southampton.

	Titanic = LOAD ------------(); //same as above//

`	B = FILTER Titanic by embarked matches 'S';

	C = FILTER B survived==0;

	E = FOREACH D generate GROUP, COUNT(C.survived);

	dump E;

	Titanic = LOAD ----------(); //same as above//

	B = FILTER Titanic by survived==1;

	C = FILTER B by sex=='male';

	D = GROUP C by all;

	E = FOREACH D generate COUNT(C);

	dump E;


	C1 = FILTER B by sex=='female';

	D1 = GROUP C1 all;

	E1 = FOREACH D1 generates COUNT(C1);

	dump E1;
